## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m Qafar, a **Mobile App Developer** passionate about building smart, user-friendly applications.  
I started coding at the age of **14**, developing small web projects. Later, I transitioned to **Flutter**,  
and by **16**, I published my first apps on Google Play.  

Although my early apps were amateur, they gave me the opportunity to experiment with different technologies â€”  
including creating demo projects in **Unity** and exploring various development tools.  

Over time, my focus shifted towards **AI**, especially using **TensorFlow** for experimental projects.  
Now, my main goal is to advance in both **mobile development** and **artificial intelligence**,  
creating applications that are simple on the outside but smart under the hood.
